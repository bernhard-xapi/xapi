# About xenguest
`xenguest` is called by the xenopsd [Domain.build](Domain.build) function
to perform the build phase for new VMs, which is part of the `xenopsd`
[VM.start operation](VM.start).

[xenguest](https://github.com/xenserver/xen.pg/blob/XS-8/patches/xenguest.patch)
was created as a separate program due to issues with
`libxenguest`:

- It wasn't threadsafe: fixed, but it still uses a per-call global struct
- It had an incompatible licence, but now licensed under the LGPL.

Those were fixed, but we still shell out to `xenguest`, which is currently
carried in the patch queue for the Xen hypervisor packages, but could become
an individual package once planned changes to the Xen hypercalls are stabilised.

Over time, `xenguest` has evolved to build more of the initial domain state.

# Interface to xenguest

```mermaid
flowchart
subgraph xenopsd VM_build[xenopsd&nbsp;VM_build&nbsp;micro#8209;op]
direction TB
mode
domid
memmax
Xenstore
end
mode[--mode build_hvm] --> xenguest
domid --> xenguest
memmax --> xenguest
Xenstore[Xenstore platform data] --> xenguest
```

`xenopsd` must pass this information to `xenguest` to build a VM:

- The domain type to build for (HVM, PHV or PV).
  - It is passed using the command line option `--mode hvm_build`.
- The `domid` of the created empty domain,
- The amount of system memory of the domain,
- A number of other parameters that are domain-specific.

Using the Xenstore, the platform data (vCPUs, vCPU affinity, etc.) is passed:
- the vCPU affinity
- the vCPU credit2 weight/cap parameters
- whether the NX bit is exposed
- whether the viridian CPUID leaf is exposed
- whether the system has PAE or not
- whether the system has ACPI or not
- whether the system has nested HVM or not
- whether the system has an HPET or not

When called to build a domain, `xenguest` reads those and builds the VM accordingly.

## Walkthrough of the xenguest build mode

    setup_mem#40;#41;&nbsp;#8209;>&nbsp;Xen&nbsp;hypercalls&nbsp;to&nbsp;setup&nbsp;domain&nbsp;memory
]
end
```

Based on the given domain type, the `xenguest` program calls dedicated
functions for the build process of the given domain type.

These are:

- `stub_xc_hvm_build()` for HVM,
- `stub_xc_pvh_build()` for PVH, and
- `stub_xc_pv_build()` for PV domains.

These domain build functions call these functions:

1. `get_flags()` to get the platform data from the Xenstore
2. `configure_vcpus()` which uses the platform data from the Xenstore to configure vCPU affinity and the credit scheduler parameters vCPU weight and vCPU cap (max % pCPU time for throttling)
3.  The `setup_mem` function for the given VM type.

## The function hvm_build_setup_mem()

For HVM domains, `hvm_build_setup_mem()` is responsible for deriving the memory
layout of the new domain, allocating the required memory and populating for the
new domain. It must:

1.  Derive the `e820` memory layout of the system memory of the domain
    including memory holes depending on PCI passthrough and vGPU flags.
2.  Load the BIOS/UEFI firmware images
3.  Store the final MMIO hole parameters in the Xenstore
4.  Call the `libxenguest` function `xc_dom_boot_mem_init()` (see below)
5.  Call `construct_cpuid_policy()` to apply the CPUID `featureset` policy

## The function xc_dom_boot_mem_init()

```mermaid

subgraph xenguest
hvm_build_setup_mem[hvm_build_setup_mem#40;#41;]
end
subgraph libxenguest
hvm_build_setup_mem --> xc_dom_boot_mem_init[xc_dom_boot_mem_init#40;#41;]

end
```

`hvm_build_setup_mem()` calls
[xc_dom_boot_mem_init()](https://github.com/xen-project/xen/blob/39c45c/tools/libs/guest/xg_dom_boot.c#L110-L126)
to allocate and populate the domain's system memory.

It calls
[meminit_hvm()](https://github.com/xen-project/xen/blob/39c45c/tools/libs/guest/xg_dom_x86.c#L1348-L1648)
to loop over the `vmemranges` of the domain for mapping the system RAM
of the guest from the Xen hypervisor heap. Its goals are:

- Attempt to allocate 1GB superpages when possible
- Fall back to 2MB pages when 1GB allocation failed
- Fall back to 4k pages when both failed

It uses the hypercall
[XENMEM_populate_physmap](https://github.com/xen-project/xen/blob/39c45c/xen/common/memory.c#L1408-L1477)
to perform memory allocation and to map the allocated memory
to the system RAM ranges of the domain.

https://github.com/xen-project/xen/blob/39c45c/xen/common/memory.c#L1022-L1071

`XENMEM_populate_physmap`:

1.  Uses
    [construct_memop_from_reservation](https://github.com/xen-project/xen/blob/39c45c/xen/common/memory.c#L1022-L1071)
    to convert the arguments for allocating a page from
    [struct xen_memory_reservation](https://github.com/xen-project/xen/blob/master/xen/include/public/memory.h#L46-L80)
    to `struct memop_args`.
2.  Sets flags and calls functions according to the arguments
3.  Allocates the requested page at the most suitable place
    - depending on passed flags, allocate on a specific NUMA node
    - else, if the domain has node affinity, on the affine nodes
    - also in the most suitable memory zone within the NUMA node
4.  Falls back to less desirable places if this fails
    - or fail for "exact" allocation requests
5.  When no pages of the requested size are free,
    it splits larger superpages into pages of the requested size.
